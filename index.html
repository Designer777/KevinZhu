      <h3> Hi There! <h3>
    </center>
    <p> My name is Kevin Zhu. I'm a grade 11 student at Victoria Park Collegiate Institite who is currently enrolled in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. </p>
    <p> My favourite subjects are mathematics and computer programming. After high school, I wish to pursue a career in computer science. </p>
    <p> Besides academics, I have been heavily involved in tech-related extracurriculars. I have been participating in FIRST Robotics since grade 8. </p>
    <p> I have participated in a First Lego League (FLL) challenge and many First Robotics Competition (FRC) challenges. </p>
    <p> In addition, I have also ran EV3 Robotics workshops and Scratch Programming workshops.</p>
